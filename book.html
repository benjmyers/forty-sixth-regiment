Let Pennsylvanians then rally around the old standard, support our noble Governor in the pledges he has made in behalf of the State of which he is justly proud, respond promptly to his call, and before the festive days of Christmas make the annual round you will have returned to your homes with the consciousness of having performed a sacred duty, and earned the glorious title of an &quot;American citizen.&quot;</div>

                Captain George A. Brooks, a printer from Harrisburg, PA, started a diary on January 1st, 1862. For the next nine months, his daily record provides detailed accounts of some of the Civil War's most studied events, including the Shenandoah Valley Campaign, and the battles at First Winchester and Cedar Mountain. Combined with his personal correspondence, newspaper articles, other firsthand accounts, and historical context, <em>American Citizen</em> tells the story of a young man trying to balance a life left behind with the tribulations of commanding men in combat.
